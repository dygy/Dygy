# Greetings, stranger üïµüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
## My name is Arkadii, but you can call me Adi.

```typescript
I am a software engineer specializing in the field of 
React/Typescript/Next.js/FE-AQA/Videoplayers, 
with a product vision I have worked in completely 
different areas (mainly B2B), understanding and 
interested in business priorities and user experience, 
and attentive to documentation for integrations, testing, 
onboarding (and new employees to the project and users to the product) 
and deployment, reverse studying Jira, git and other sources of project 
history to understand the intricacies and processes, not afraid to take 
responsibility for areas unknown to me and to integrate into them.
I have experience in project support and migration, formation of 
jira-flow/jira-automation-flow teams, scrum, git flow, 
release and engineering culture
